Here is our code and solution from II place at SENSE group hackathon (01.03.2024). <br/>
<br/>
We solved the problem "Match vacancy and cv" using: <br/>
- **data parsers** (hh vacancy and cv's), created for finding data; <br/>
- **data preprocessing** - splitted original dataset on groups of keywords, needs to best score; <br/>
- **ML models** - distilBERT (embeddigns) and SiameseNN (match). <br/>
<br/>
**Judges appreciated our solution well, especially the idea and part with big data preparing.** <br/>
